# Question
What is wrong with this code?

```js
const printDouble = (num) => console.log(num * 2);
const nums = [1,2,3];
nums.forEach(printDouble());
```

# Answer
In the `nums.forEach` nothing is being passed in the function.

2/3.
Almost! The callback function `(num) => console.log(num * 2);` is stored within the `printDouble` variable. So, to make this work, we can simply pass the `printDouble` variable by itself to the `nums.forEach()` method like so:

```js
const printDouble = (num) => console.log(num * 2);
const nums = [1, 2, 3];
nums.forEach(printDouble);
```
